The main goal of the Java language is portability for consumer electronics.

How can I develop a programming language that works on different electronic devices?

The Java language was developed in 1995. Before that, the C (1972) and C++ (1979â€“1985) languages were developed. The C language paradigm is primarily imperative and procedural programming and also supports aspects of structured programming. C++ also supports the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm. The main difference between C/C++ and Java is portability. C and C++ depend on the compiler, but this does not happen in Java.
For us to understand this, we need to answer the question: How is program code produced?
First, humans write code that the computer can understand, and this code is translated into machine code as binary instructions. This process can be done by compiling or interpreting, and this process depends of architeture and operational systems.
The java languagem is plataform-independent programming language, but how does it happen? the java language have a intermediare virtual machine, in order that, the byte-codes is not for a plataform-specific aplplication, but for that intermediare virtual machine and this virtual machine itself a plataform-specific application, the virtual machine executes your application by translating java byte-code instructions into plataform-specific code
The Java language is a platform-independent programming language, but how does this happen? The Java language has an intermediate virtual machine. Therefore, the bytecode is not for a platform-specific application, but for that intermediate virtual machine. This virtual machine itself is a platform-specific application. The virtual machine executes your application by translating Java bytecode instructions into platform-specific code. basically: Virtual-Machine translates java byte-code(.class) to plataform-specific code.
